  <p>
  The SEARAT Amateur Radio Club (SARC) is for those interested in furthering their radio communication skills and obtaining FCC licenses.
  We hope that it is an opportunity to explore the vast opportunities in the radio art and science, and use the knowledge and skills obtained through a fun-filled, challenging hobby to improve military radio communications.
  There is no cost for membership. If interested in joining or just curious about what is going on, please email the link below.
  We will use the distro list to let folks know about radio communications related events, including fun lunchtime classes, Parks on the Air adventures, or a lunchtime check-in net.
